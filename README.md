Welcome to the world of accurate and versatile regression analysis with the conformalInference.multi R package! 
This repository hosts a powerful tool that allows you to generate valid prediction regions at levels 1-α or 1-2α in multivariate response regression. What sets this package apart is its ability to handle a wide range of data distributions, eliminating the need for Gaussian assumptions commonly found in traditional methods.

The package releases the freedom to perform regression analysis without being constrained by the requirement of assuming Gaussian data. With conformalInference.multi, you can embrace a non-parametric approach that accommodates various data distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. This versatility empowers you to gain robust insights and make accurate predictions in diverse regression tasks.

Developed as part of a Master's thesis in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, this package extends the renowned Conformal Prediction methods for univariate response regression to handle multivariate response data.

## Code Structure

The conformalInference.multi package is thoughtfully organized into three main families of functions, designed to simplify your regression analysis workflow:

1. Prediction methods: These functions compute prediction regions, enabling you to make accurate predictions with confidence.
2. Regression methods: This family of functions encompasses various regression algorithms. You have the flexibility to use built-in regression methods or incorporate your own custom-coded algorithms tailored to your specific needs.
3. Plot methods: Visualize and interpret the output of prediction methods with ease using the plot functions provided by this package.

By separating the prediction and regression methods, conformalInference.multi empowers you to tailor your regression analysis to suit your unique requirements, providing ultimate flexibility and customization.
