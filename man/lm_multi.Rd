\title{Linear Modeling of Multivariate Response}
\usage{
lm_multi()
}
\value{
A list with the training function and the prediction function.
}
\description{
This model is fed to conformal prediction functions.
It outputs a training function and a prediction function.
}
\details{
The training function takes as input:

x The feature matrix  (dim n x p)
y The response matrix (dim n x q)

The predict function, instead, takes as input:

out The output of a previous call to train.fun
newx The new features to evaluate (i.e. an n0 x p matrix)
Here I defined an lm model for every dimension of the responses (q).
